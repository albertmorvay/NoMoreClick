# NoMoreClick
> NoMoreClick is a simple mouse click (autoclick) utility aimed at reducing the number of left-clicks the user must perform during normal usage e.g. web-browsing etc. to interact with the computer. This tool is being written to fit my specific needs.

## Development setup

Windows:
1. Install your favourite Integrated development environment (IDE) for C# e.g. [Visual Studios Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

2. With an IDE installed, ensure that you have the [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.0).

3. If you haven't already install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and/or your perferred Git client e.g. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to gain access to the code.

4. Fork this repository and get clone the repository.

Note: After cloning the repository you will have the `master` branch checked out. This is likely not the most recent version of the code. You will want to checkout a branch. Check the Projects for the In Progress

5. Using your IDE, open the project's `.sln` file. This will open the project within your IDE. Once open in the IDE, you are ready to go.
